# MyCyberLog

Welcome to **MyCyberLog** – my personal space where I document what I’ve been learning, experimenting with, and exploring in the world of **IT** and **Cyber Security**.  

This project started as a way to keep track of my progress, but it also serves as a way to share my notes, thoughts, and experiments with others who are just as excited about technology and cybersecurity as I am.  

## 🔍 What you’ll find here
- Personal write-ups on what I’ve learned so far  
- Notes on Cyber Security, Bug Bounty, Pentesting, IT, and more  
- A simple log of my progress that I can look back on over time
- A mini CTF on the Contact page, that has a very special surprise waiting for you ;)

## 🚀 Goals
- To build a habit of **writing down what I learn**  
- To keep an open record of my growth in IT and Cyber Security  
- To share knowledge and maybe help others who are on a similar journey  

## 🌐 Live site
