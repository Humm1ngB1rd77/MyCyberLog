            This project utilizes an Elegoo (Arduino) Uno R3 microcontroller, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor,
            seven LEDs, and corresponding 220-ohm resistors to create a visual distance indicator.
            The HC-SR04 sensor works by emitting ultrasonic waves and measuring the time it takes
            for them to bounce back after hitting an object. The Arduino processes this data to
            calculate the distance of the object from the sensor. As the object gets closer,
            more LEDs light up in sequence, providing an intuitive visual representation of proximity.
            This project is a great way to understand distance sensing and microcontroller-based control
            systems, making it suitable for beginners and hobbyists interested in electronics and programming.

        <h2>Where the idea came from</h2>
        <p>
            I first came across a similar project while browsing the internet and was intrigued by how simple yet
            effective it was in visualizing distance using LEDs. Seeing how others had implemented it inspired me to
            test it myself and gain hands-on experience. You can check out the original project
            <a href="https://www.mrelectrouino.com/2019/07/arduino-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04.html" style="color: var(--accent);" target="_blank">HERE</a>.

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
            From working on this Arduino project, I learned a lot about both hardware and software components.
            I gained hands-on experience with connecting various electronic components like sensors and LEDs
            to the Arduino board, which helped me understand how these components interact in a circuit.
            On the software side, I learned how to write and upload code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE,
            as well as how to troubleshoot and debug issues with the code. Additionally, I became more familiar
            with basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and input/output handling, all of
            which are essential for creating interactive and functional projects. Overall, this project
            improved my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of electronics and programming.
