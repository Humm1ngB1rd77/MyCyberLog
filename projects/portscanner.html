    <p>
      I built a simple Python port scanner after following a YouTube tutorial, but most of the learning happened
      while getting the development environment ready. The first big step was getting a Linux terminal on my Windows 11 laptop.
      I installed the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and set up Ubuntu so I could use familiar Linux tools, install packages,
      and run the exact commands used in the tutorial. Having a real Linux shell made it much easier to follow along and experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
      My initial attempt to enable WSL with the plain <code>wsl --install</code> command failed and produced confusing errors.
      The fix for me was to explicitly install Ubuntu. Running the installer with the distribution specified (for example
      <code>wsl --install -d Ubuntu</code>) succeeded and gave me access to a bash terminal inside Windows. After that I could update
      packages, install tools, and treat the environment like any other Ubuntu system.
    </p>

    <p>
      For writing a python script, I used Visual Studio Code, so I had to learn how to open and use the integrated WSL/Ubuntu terminal inside VS Code.
      The editor‚Äôs built-in terminal dropdown lets you choose the default shell ‚Äî once pointed at WSL it opens bash
      inside the editor window. I was extremly happy to see that a Ubuntu terminal successfully opened in VS code.

    <h2>Where the idea came from</h2>

    <p>
      The idea came from searching for good beginner-friendly cyber-security Python projects;
      while researching I found a short YouTube tutorial that walked through a simple TCP port
      scanner step-by-step. I followed that video closely ‚Äî the scanner code itself is written
      by the original creator (see the tutorial
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhn9-PQBN7g&t=28s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--accent);">
        here on YouTube
      </a>)
      ‚Äî and what I‚Äôm sharing in this post is only my explanation of the steps I took and what
      I learned while reproducing and experimenting with their code.
    </p>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>

    <p>
      There were several practical takeaways from the whole process. First,
      in Ubuntu you typically run Python with <code>python3</code> (e.g., <code>python3 PortScanner.py</code>),
      because the plain <code>python</code> command may not point to Python 3 on a fresh system.
      I also installed <code>pip</code> to manage Python packages and installed utilities
      like <code>nmap</code>. To get those tools set up I updated the package lists and installed the
      packages from the WSL terminal ‚Äî <code>sudo apt update</code> followed by
      <code>sudo apt install nmap python3-nmap</code> (and <code>sudo apt install python3-pip</code> to install pip)
      ‚Äî which completed successfully and let me use <code>nmap</code> and the Python nmap bindings
      from within the same Ubuntu environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      I learned how important file location is: keeping the project in the WSL filesystem (not on the Windows side)
      avoids permission and path issues when running commands from bash. I also learned to use the VS Code Remote - WSL features
      so the editor behaves as if it‚Äôs running inside Ubuntu, which keeps environment and dependency handling consistent.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the code side, the making of the scanner itself reinforced my python programming knowledge.
      Even tho, I have a long way to go and that this project did not require me to write code by myself,
      I got familiar with some interesting aspects of writing code in python.
      I also got to know how to use nmap inside a python script and what <code>sV and sC</code> means.
    </p>

    <h3>Disclaimer!!!</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>
        Always obtain explicit authorization before scanning any network, host, or service.
        Unauthorized port scanning can be considered intrusive activity and may violate terms
        of service or local laws. Run scans only against machines you own, systems you have written
        permission to test, or purpose-built public test servers. One well-known, permissioned
        target is <code>scanme.nmap.org</code>, which the Nmap project provides for testing and learning
        ‚Äî use it (or your own lab) rather than scanning random third-party sites.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      To confirm the IP address of a host you plan to scan from the WSL/Ubuntu bash terminal,
      you can use: <code>dig +short scanme.nmap.org</code> ‚Äî this returns the numeric IP(s) for
      <code>scanme.nmap.org</code> so you can be sure you are targeting the intended test host.
