  <h1 class="post-title">Why I Chose Cybersecurity (And Where I'm Going With It)</h1>
  <article class="post">


    <h2>Who I Am and Where I’m At</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Jernej, a second-year undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at <em>Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana</em>. I’m majoring in Information and Communications Technology, and about eight months ago, I made a shift in my interests toward cybersecurity. Up until last September, I was convinced I’d go into automation technology — but something about cyber just clicked with me. Even though I’m still very much a beginner and juggling a full academic load, I’ve been trying to carve out time to learn and explore this field on my own.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p>The concept of hacking always felt magical to me — mysterious, powerful, and just out of reach. I know now that cybersecurity is much more than just “hacking,” but that initial spark was enough to pull me in. Once I started diving deeper into the world of cyber, I found something that clicked: the idea that I could learn how systems are attacked and defended, and use that knowledge to help others and bring real value. When I explore cybersecurity, it feels like I’m learning something meaningful — almost like a modern virtue. I’m gaining insight into how today’s digital world works, and even though it sometimes scares me, it also inspires me.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>What I’ve Done So Far</h2>
    <p>Right now, I’m enrolled in three courses: NahamSec’s Bug Bounty course, and two Hack The Box paths — Bug Bounty Hunter and Linux Fundamentals. My university has given me a solid foundation in operating systems and information systems, but I’ve realized that if I want to truly understand cybersecurity, I have to go beyond the classroom and put in the extra effort myself.</p>
    <p>One hands-on project I’m proud of is building an ESP8266 Wi-Fi deauther, which I even presented in class during a session on Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks. That project taught me a lot about how wireless networks can be exploited — and how vulnerable they can be.</p>
    <p>At the same time, this journey hasn’t been easy. I’m currently finding it really difficult to spot actual vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs. I understand the basic ideas, but using tools effectively, learning the necessary protocols, and navigating the entire process is still a big challenge. The hardest part so far has been getting comfortable with Linux, understanding how security tools work, and building confidence with the protocols involved.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>What I’ve Learned</h2>
    <p>In the past several months, I’ve picked up a lot of foundational knowledge — especially in networking. I now have a much better understanding of how routers and switches work, how network architectures are designed, and how data flows through systems. I’ve studied both the OSI and TCP/IP models and their protocols, and while I’m not fluent yet, I can feel things starting to make more sense. I’ve also learned quite a bit about HTTP, HTTPS, and VPNs, which has helped me understand how information travels securely (or sometimes insecurely) across the internet.</p>
    <p>One major shift happened about three months into my cybersecurity journey. I realized that before I could do anything advanced — like penetration testing or vulnerability hunting — I first had to master the fundamentals. That meant going deep into networking, understanding how protocols work, and figuring out how data moves, where it lives, and how it can be accessed or protected. I’ve come to believe that no time is ever wasted on learning the basics — and the more I strengthen that foundation, the more everything else starts to “click” into place.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <p>In the short term, my main goal is to land a job in networking so I can start gaining real-world experience. Learning theory is one thing, but applying it in practice — troubleshooting issues, configuring systems, understanding environments — that’s where the real growth happens. I want to get my hands dirty.</p>
    <p>This summer, I plan to complete the three cybersecurity courses I’m currently enrolled in, get more comfortable with Wireshark, and learn to use web proxies effectively — especially in the context of web application testing. Beyond that, I’m working toward earning my Cisco CCNA certification and also plan to get a radio amateur license in the coming year.</p>
    <p>Right now, I’m focused on building a strong foundation — not just rushing to be a “hacker,” but learning things the right way. If I stay consistent, my goal is to graduate next year with the skills and confidence to step into a full-time cybersecurity role, while continuing to work on bug bounties in my spare time. And through all of it, I want to keep updating this blog — to track my journey, share what I learn, and hopefully grow into someone who can give back to the same community that’s inspiring me now.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why I’m Starting This Blog</h2>
    <p>I started this blog for a few reasons. First, it’s a way for me to keep track of what I’m learning — like a public notebook that documents my journey. But more than that, I hope it becomes something useful to others. Whether you're just starting out in cybersecurity or already in the field and facing a problem I’ve tackled (or am still struggling with), maybe something here will help. Or maybe we can figure it out together.</p>
    <p>I want to make myself visible — not necessarily as someone who already knows it all, but as someone who’s genuinely trying, learning, and improving every day. I’ll be writing about what I’m working on, what I find interesting, what confuses me, and what excites me. Some posts will be educational, others will be more like personal journal entries or reflections.</p>
    <p>My mindset is simple: grow, help others grow, and build something meaningful. I want cybersecurity to be more than just a job — I want it to be a passion and a lifestyle. In a world that’s becoming more digital by the day, I want to help as many people as possible understand the risks they face and how to protect themselves. If I can turn that into a career <em>and</em> a community, that would be the biggest win of all.</p>
