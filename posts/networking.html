    <h2>What Is Networking?</h2>
    <p>
      Networking, in simple terms, is how computers and devices connect and communicate with each other. Whether it‚Äôs sending an email, browsing a website, or watching Netflix ‚Äî it‚Äôs all made possible through networking.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its core, networking is about <strong>sharing data and resources</strong> between devices. These devices could be in the same room, across a city, or even on opposite sides of the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Networking Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Without networking:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The internet wouldn't exist.</li>
      <li>You couldn‚Äôt access websites, apps, or online services.</li>
      <li>Organizations couldn‚Äôt connect employees, systems, or data.</li>
      <li>Cybersecurity would have nothing to protect ‚Äî or attack.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the world of cybersecurity, understanding how networks operate is essential. If you know how data moves, you can also understand how to protect it ‚Äî or how someone might try to steal it.
    </p>

    <h2>What Does Networking Include?</h2>
    <p>
      There‚Äôs a lot under the hood, but here‚Äôs a taste of what networking covers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> Like a home address for your computer.</li>
      <li><strong>Routers & Switches:</strong> They direct traffic between devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Ports & Protocols:</strong> Rules of communication (e.g., HTTP, DNS, SSH).</li>
      <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Gatekeepers that allow or block traffic.</li>
      <li><strong>DNS:</strong> The internet‚Äôs phonebook ‚Äì converting names into IP addresses.</li>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> <code>ping</code>, <code>traceroute</code>, <code>Wireshark</code>, and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Thoughts as a Beginner</h2>
    <p>
      As someone transitioning into IT and cybersecurity, I‚Äôve quickly learned that <strong>networking is everywhere</strong>. Even though it seemed intimidating at first, breaking it down has made it more approachable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don‚Äôt need to know it all at once ‚Äî and neither do you. The key is to <strong>understand the basics</strong> and build from there. Networking is not just for ‚Äúnetwork engineers.‚Äù It‚Äôs for anyone in tech.
    </p>

    <h2>What‚Äôs Next?</h2>
    <p>
      As I continue learning and growing in IT and cybersecurity, I‚Äôll be sharing more posts that reflect <em>my</em> learning path. Rather than following a fixed curriculum, I‚Äôll focus on topics that click with me or that I find interesting or challenging at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the next things I plan to explore is the <strong>OSI and TCP/IP models</strong> ‚Äî they seem to come up a lot and form the foundation of how networking works. I want to understand <em>why</em> they matter, not just memorize the layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, if you're also figuring this out as you go, you're in the right place. My goal isn't to teach from an expert's perspective but to share what I‚Äôm learning as I learn it ‚Äî in a way that makes sense to beginners.
